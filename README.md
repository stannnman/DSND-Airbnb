# airbnb Seattle 2016 #
"Become a Data Scientist" Udacity Nanodegree, Term #2, Project #1

### Key Deliverables: ###
- **airbnb_seattle.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook with technical data manipulation and analysis.
- **Airbnb Seattle Blog Post.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook for the non-technical blog post.

### Libraries Used ###
- **numpy** and **pandas** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data viz
- **sklearn** for data normalisation

### Motivation ###
As a keen traveller who has never been to Seattle, I see this project as an opportunity to learn about the city before my first visit.

### Purpose: ###
This project seeks to answer the following business questions:
- What are the five most expensive neighbourhoods in Seattle for Airbnb?
- What is the most expensive time of year to visit Seattle?
- What factors can influence the price of an Airbnb listing?

### Conclusion: ###
- Five most expensive neighbourhoods are Magnolia, Downtown, Queen Anne, Cascade and Ballard.
- Most expensive period is Jul-Aug, with most expensive date in 2016 being 1st July.
- Factors that influence the price are how many people the property can accommodate, how far west it is located and the number of properties the host manages.
